## ⚡ Fun Facts

- I love combining **satellite imagery** + **ML** to solve real challenges (e.g. agriculture, environment).  
- I’m a fan of **clean code, reproducibility, and clear documentation**.  
- I occasionally blog / write on Medium or dev platforms about remote sensing, model interpretability, etc.  
- Coffee + code is my default mode — working late nights is a feature, not a bug 😄
